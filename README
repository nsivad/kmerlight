Usage: kmerlight  -k kmerlength -f freqs  -o outputfile -i <.fa/.fa.gz/.fasta/fasta.gz OR .fq/.fq.gz/.fastq/.fastq.gz file(s)>

Eg:

kmerlight -k 15 -f 10 -o out.txt -i sample.fq

Outputs k-mer abundance histogram values F0, f1,....,f10 for all 15-mers appearing in the input FASTQ file sample.fq

kmerlight -k 21 -f 1000 -o out.txt -i inp1.fq inp2.fq

Outputs k-mer abundance histogram values F0, f1,....,f1000 for all 21-mers appearing in the input FASTQ files inp1.fq and inp2.fq. The output is written to out.txt file.
